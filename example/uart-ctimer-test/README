UART and ctimer test example.
=============================

This very simple demo tests the functionality of the UART output and the ctimer library in order to
print the current system time (seconds count) to the standard output.

Building.
---------
To compile the demo, simply provide a target name (e.g. teensy-lc, teensy-32 or teensy-36) to the
make command:
$ make TARGET=teensy-32

You can clean all generated files (except .elf and .hex) with this command:
$ make TARGET=teensy-32 clean

And to clean all output files use this command:
$ make TARGET=teensy-32 distclean

Testing.
--------
At the time of creation of this example, the standard output of the teensy boards is transmitted by
default through UART on pin number 1 (TX), at 115200 baud per second (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop
bit). You can use any serial-to-usb adapter and your favorite serial terminal program for this
purpose.
